Unlike some bars, one of the best burgers in the city actually resides at The Earl. Other options are tasty too, vegans and vegetarians are allowed to come here!\r\n\r\nWhat really sets them apart is the type of people you see here. You walk up and there's a nice cozy outside patio area. Walk inside and there's a plethora of tables and a good sized bar area. The people here are so nice and down to earth, the bartenders obviously have plenty of regulars here.\r\n\r\nSmoking is allowed in the bar area and on occasion inside the music room, but typically it's smoke-free for shows. Talking about shows, there's so much to say! They have a tiny little bar area back there, but luckily a ton of room overall to see your band play. The Earl has the most intimate music area at least that I've seen – you can get super close to the band, it's up to you how much hearing loss you're okay with.\r\n\r\nThe sound is excellent, unfortunately the awesome sound guy they have now is leaving, so hopefully the quality can keep up. Nonetheless, The Earl has great acts pretty consistently and is such a great place to see music at, one of the best in the city.","is_family_friendly":false,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/theearl.jpg","thumb_small":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_small.jpg","thumb_medium":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_medium.jpg","tags":[{"name":"dive bar","slug":"dive-bar"},{"name":"indie music","slug":"indie-music"}],"created_at":"2019-05-13T17:09:39+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:16:24+00:00","category":{"id":1,"name":"Music","slug":"music","is_default":true,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/674/category-music.jpg","created_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00"}},"bands":[{"id":651,"name":"K Michelle Dubois","slug":"k-michelle-dubois","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1819/651-k-michelle-dubois.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/2M8M9NxuEmOAaqlbEHN5LW","created_at":"2019-08-12T13:58:36+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:58:36+00:00"},{"id":652,"name":"Rosser","slug":"rosser","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1820/652-rosser.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6ypN3wIHAtTGE2Vxv1WGuO","created_at":"2019-08-12T13:58:36+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:58:38+00:00"},{"id":653,"name":"DJ Chris Devoe","slug":"dj-chris-devoe","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1821/653-dj-chris-devoe.jpg","spotify_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-12T13:58:36+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:58:36+00:00"}]},{"id":1154,"name":"The Midnight Hour","slug":"the-midnight-hour-september-13-2019-music-aisle-5","location_id":6,"user_id":1,"category_id":1,"event_type_id":2,"start_date":"2019-09-13","end_date":null,"price":"$20.00 - $25.00","start_time":"9:00 PM","end_time":"12:00 AM","short_description":"See live music at Aisle 5 on Friday, September 13th.

Unlike some bars, one of the best burgers in the city actually resides at The Earl. Other options are tasty too, vegans and vegetarians are allowed to come here!\r\n\r\nWhat really sets them apart is the type of people you see here. You walk up and there's a nice cozy outside patio area. Walk inside and there's a plethora of tables and a good sized bar area. The people here are so nice and down to earth, the bartenders obviously have plenty of regulars here.\r\n\r\nSmoking is allowed in the bar area and on occasion inside the music room, but typically it's smoke-free for shows. Talking about shows, there's so much to say! They have a tiny little bar area back there, but luckily a ton of room overall to see your band play. The Earl has the most intimate music area at least that I've seen – you can get super close to the band, it's up to you how much hearing loss you're okay with.\r\n\r\nThe sound is excellent, unfortunately the awesome sound guy they have now is leaving, so hopefully the quality can keep up. Nonetheless, The Earl has great acts pretty consistently and is such a great place to see music at, one of the best in the city.","is_family_friendly":false,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/theearl.jpg","thumb_small":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_small.jpg","thumb_medium":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_medium.jpg","tags":[{"name":"dive bar","slug":"dive-bar"},{"name":"indie music","slug":"indie-music"}],"created_at":"2019-05-13T17:09:39+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:16:24+00:00","category":{"id":1,"name":"Music","slug":"music","is_default":true,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/674/category-music.jpg","created_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00"}},"bands":[{"id":654,"name":"Worn-Tin","slug":"worn-tin","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1824/654-worn-tin.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/7j8ds7BnqaEKuz1a1GN0J9","created_at":"2019-08-12T13:58:49+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:58:52+00:00"}]},{"id":1395,"name":"Open Mic Night","slug":"open-mic-night-september-15-2019-other-red-light-cafe","location_id":12,"user_id":1,"category_id":5,"event_type_id":2,"start_date":"2019-09-15","end_date":null,"price":"$5 Door (Goes to Prize Pool)","start_time":"8:00 PM","end_time":"11:00 PM","short_description":"NOTE: If you're performing with pre-recorded music, please have that music on a phone (or other device) with a headphone jack.","description":null,"featured":false,"is_sold_out":false,"website":"https://redlightcafe.com/events/open-mic-night-sep-15-2019","is_family_friendly":false,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/3455/1395-open-mic-night-september-15-2019-other-red-light-cafe.jpg","thumb_mobile":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/3455/conversions/1395-open-mic-night-september-15-2019-other-red-light-cafe-thumb_mobile.jpg","thumb_tablet":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/3455/conversions/1395-open-mic-night-september-15-2019-other-red-light-cafe-thumb_tablet.jpg","thumb_desktop":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/3455/conversions/1395-open-mic-night-september-15-2019-other-red-light-cafe-thumb_desktop.jpg","tags":[],"created_at":"2019-09-06T21:56:18+00:00","updated_at":"2019-09-06T21:56:18+00:00","category":{"name":"Other","slug":"other"},"category_slug":"other","location_slug":"red-light-cafe","event_type":"Event","location":{"id":12,"name":"Red Light Cafe","slug":"red-light-cafe","category_id":1,"website":"https://redlightcafe.com","address":"553-1 Amsterdam Avenue","city":"Atlanta","state":"GA","zip":"30306","latitude":"33.7876000","longitude":"-84.3583000","description":null,"is_family_friendly":false,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/3422/red-light-cafe.jpg","thumb_small":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/3422/conversions/red-light-cafe-thumb_small.jpg","thumb_medium":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/3422/conversions/red-light-cafe-thumb_medium.jpg","tags":[],"created_at":"2019-09-04T18:29:12+00:00","updated_at":"2019-09-04T18:29:12+00:00","category":{"id":1,"name":"Music","slug":"music","is_default":true,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/674/category-music.jpg","created_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00"}}},{"id":1012,"name":"Jordy Searcy","slug":"jordy-searcy-september-15-2019-music-eddies-attic","location_id":7,"user_id":1,"category_id":1,"event_type_id":2,"start_date":"2019-09-15","end_date":null,"price":"$12 - $15","start_time":"8:00 PM","end_time":"11:00 PM","short_description":"See live music at Eddie's Attic on Sunday, September 15th.

Unlike some bars, one of the best burgers in the city actually resides at The Earl. Other options are tasty too, vegans and vegetarians are allowed to come here!\r\n\r\nWhat really sets them apart is the type of people you see here. You walk up and there's a nice cozy outside patio area. Walk inside and there's a plethora of tables and a good sized bar area. The people here are so nice and down to earth, the bartenders obviously have plenty of regulars here.\r\n\r\nSmoking is allowed in the bar area and on occasion inside the music room, but typically it's smoke-free for shows. Talking about shows, there's so much to say! They have a tiny little bar area back there, but luckily a ton of room overall to see your band play. The Earl has the most intimate music area at least that I've seen – you can get super close to the band, it's up to you how much hearing loss you're okay with.\r\n\r\nThe sound is excellent, unfortunately the awesome sound guy they have now is leaving, so hopefully the quality can keep up. Nonetheless, The Earl has great acts pretty consistently and is such a great place to see music at, one of the best in the city.","is_family_friendly":false,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/theearl.jpg","thumb_small":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_small.jpg","thumb_medium":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_medium.jpg","tags":[{"name":"dive bar","slug":"dive-bar"},{"name":"indie music","slug":"indie-music"}],"created_at":"2019-05-13T17:09:39+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:16:24+00:00","category":{"id":1,"name":"Music","slug":"music","is_default":true,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/674/category-music.jpg","created_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00"}},"bands":[{"id":655,"name":"Sinkane","slug":"sinkane","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1827/655-sinkane.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/0ip3L7jX2aq8T1VTJRFZ9w","created_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:00+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:00+00:00"}]},{"id":849,"name":"Venkmans Presents Joe Gransdens Jazz Jam","slug":"venkmans-presents-joe-gransdens-jazz-jam-september-17-2019-music-venkmans","location_id":5,"user_id":1,"category_id":1,"event_type_id":2,"start_date":"2019-09-17","end_date":null,"price":"Special","start_time":"8:00 PM","end_time":null,"short_description":"See live music at Venkman's on Tuesday, September 17th.

Unlike some bars, one of the best burgers in the city actually resides at The Earl. Other options are tasty too, vegans and vegetarians are allowed to come here!\r\n\r\nWhat really sets them apart is the type of people you see here. You walk up and there's a nice cozy outside patio area. Walk inside and there's a plethora of tables and a good sized bar area. The people here are so nice and down to earth, the bartenders obviously have plenty of regulars here.\r\n\r\nSmoking is allowed in the bar area and on occasion inside the music room, but typically it's smoke-free for shows. Talking about shows, there's so much to say! They have a tiny little bar area back there, but luckily a ton of room overall to see your band play. The Earl has the most intimate music area at least that I've seen – you can get super close to the band, it's up to you how much hearing loss you're okay with.\r\n\r\nThe sound is excellent, unfortunately the awesome sound guy they have now is leaving, so hopefully the quality can keep up. Nonetheless, The Earl has great acts pretty consistently and is such a great place to see music at, one of the best in the city.","is_family_friendly":false,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/theearl.jpg","thumb_small":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_small.jpg","thumb_medium":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_medium.jpg","tags":[{"name":"dive bar","slug":"dive-bar"},{"name":"indie music","slug":"indie-music"}],"created_at":"2019-05-13T17:09:39+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:16:24+00:00","category":{"id":1,"name":"Music","slug":"music","is_default":true,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/674/category-music.jpg","created_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00"}},"bands":[{"id":656,"name":"Seratones","slug":"seratones","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1828/656-seratones.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/7D9TOQJq1HnpnQZlNNYWqc","created_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:02+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:03+00:00"},{"id":657,"name":"Wanderwild","slug":"wanderwild","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1829/657-wanderwild.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1UaakNB6sGB5ay8xkNs8QQ","created_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:02+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:06+00:00"}]},{"id":594,"name":"Christian French: Bright Side Of The Moon Tour With Special Guest Astn","slug":"christian-french-bright-side-of-the-moon-tour-with-special-guest-astn-september-19-2019-music-aisle-5","location_id":6,"user_id":1,"category_id":1,"event_type_id":2,"start_date":"2019-09-19","end_date":null,"price":"$12.00","start_time":"9:00 PM","end_time":"12:00 AM","short_description":"See live music at Aisle 5 on Thursday, September 19th at 9:00 PM with bands including Christian French.","description":null,"featured":false,"is_sold_out":false,"website":"https://www.aisle5atl.com/event/1864103-christian-french-bright-side-atlanta","is_family_friendly":false,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/649/594-christian-french-bright-side-of-the-moon-tour-with-special-guest-astn.jpg","thumb_mobile":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/649/conversions/594-christian-french-bright-side-of-the-moon-tour-with-special-guest-astn-thumb_mobile.jpg","thumb_tablet":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/649/conversions/594-christian-french-bright-side-of-the-moon-tour-with-special-guest-astn-thumb_tablet.jpg","thumb_desktop":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/649/conversions/594-christian-french-bright-side-of-the-moon-tour-with-special-guest-astn-thumb_desktop.jpg","tags":[],"created_at":"2019-06-20T19:23:13+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-18T15:21:13+00:00","category":{"name":"Music","slug":"music"},"category_slug":"music","location_slug":"aisle-5","event_type":"Event","location":{"id":6,"name":"Aisle 5","slug":"aisle-5","category_id":1,"website":"https://www.aisle5atl.com","address":"1123 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","state":"GA","zip":"30307","latitude":"33.7638000","longitude":"-84.3513000","description":null,"is_family_friendly":false,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/475/aisle-5.jpg","thumb_small":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/475/conversions/aisle-5-thumb_small.jpg","thumb_medium":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/475/conversions/aisle-5-thumb_medium.jpg","tags":[],"created_at":"2019-06-20T15:58:01+00:00","updated_at":"2019-06-20T15:58:01+00:00","category":{"id":1,"name":"Music","slug":"music","is_default":true,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/674/category-music.jpg","created_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00"}},"bands":[{"id":435,"name":"Christian French","slug":"christian-french","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1505/435-christian-french.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/0tZkJ9uQFQNVbwwUSaxwfA","created_at":"2019-07-10T17:39:11+00:00","updated_at":"2019-07-10T17:39:11+00:00"}]},{"id":963,"name":"Pharmakon","slug":"pharmakon-september-19-2019-music-529","location_id":4,"user_id":1,"category_id":1,"event_type_id":2,"start_date":"2019-09-19","end_date":null,"price":"$12 - $15","start_time":"9:00 PM","end_time":"12:00 AM","short_description":"See live music at 529 on Thursday, September 19th.

Unlike some bars, one of the best burgers in the city actually resides at The Earl. Other options are tasty too, vegans and vegetarians are allowed to come here!\r\n\r\nWhat really sets them apart is the type of people you see here. You walk up and there's a nice cozy outside patio area. Walk inside and there's a plethora of tables and a good sized bar area. The people here are so nice and down to earth, the bartenders obviously have plenty of regulars here.\r\n\r\nSmoking is allowed in the bar area and on occasion inside the music room, but typically it's smoke-free for shows. Talking about shows, there's so much to say! They have a tiny little bar area back there, but luckily a ton of room overall to see your band play. The Earl has the most intimate music area at least that I've seen – you can get super close to the band, it's up to you how much hearing loss you're okay with.\r\n\r\nThe sound is excellent, unfortunately the awesome sound guy they have now is leaving, so hopefully the quality can keep up. Nonetheless, The Earl has great acts pretty consistently and is such a great place to see music at, one of the best in the city.","is_family_friendly":false,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/theearl.jpg","thumb_small":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_small.jpg","thumb_medium":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_medium.jpg","tags":[{"name":"dive bar","slug":"dive-bar"},{"name":"indie music","slug":"indie-music"}],"created_at":"2019-05-13T17:09:39+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:16:24+00:00","category":{"id":1,"name":"Music","slug":"music","is_default":true,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/674/category-music.jpg","created_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00"}},"bands":[{"id":658,"name":"500 Songs For Kids","slug":"500-songs-for-kids","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1830/658-500-songs-for-kids.jpg","spotify_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:09+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:09+00:00"}]},{"id":1390,"name":"Nancy Gaddy: Love, Lust What I Ate – A Second Helping!","slug":"nancy-gaddy-love-lust-what-i-ate-a-second-helping-september-20-2019-comedy-red-light-cafe","location_id":12,"user_id":1,"category_id":3,"event_type_id":2,"start_date":"2019-09-20","end_date":null,"price":"$15 Adv – $20 Door","start_time":"8:00 PM","end_time":"11:00 PM","short_description":"Nancy Gaddy brings a new edition of her acclaimed show to Red Light with new comedy songs and schtick!","description":null,"featured":false,"is_sold_out":false,"website":"https://redlightcafe.com/events/nancy-gaddy-love-lust-and-what-i-ate-a-second-helping-sep-20-2019","is_family_friendly":false,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/3439/1390-nancy-gaddy-love-lust-what-i-ate-a-second-helping-september-20-2019-comedy-red-light-cafe.jpg","thumb_mobile":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/3439/conversions/1390-nancy-gaddy-love-lust-what-i-ate-a-second-helping-september-20-2019-comedy-red-light-cafe-thumb_mobile.jpg","thumb_tablet":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/3439/conversions/1390-nancy-gaddy-love-lust-what-i-ate-a-second-helping-september-20-2019-comedy-red-light-cafe-thumb_tablet.jpg","thumb_desktop":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/3439/conversions/1390-nancy-gaddy-love-lust-what-i-ate-a-second-helping-september-20-2019-comedy-red-light-cafe-thumb_desktop.jpg","tags":[],"created_at":"2019-09-06T21:55:03+00:00","updated_at":"2019-09-06T21:55:03+00:00","category":{"name":"Comedy","slug":"comedy"},"category_slug":"comedy","location_slug":"red-light-cafe","event_type":"Event","location":{"id":12,"name":"Red Light Cafe","slug":"red-light-cafe","category_id":1,"website":"https://redlightcafe.com","address":"553-1 Amsterdam Avenue","city":"Atlanta","state":"GA","zip":"30306","latitude":"33.7876000","longitude":"-84.3583000","description":null,"is_family_friendly":false,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/3422/red-light-cafe.jpg","thumb_small":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/3422/conversions/red-light-cafe-thumb_small.jpg","thumb_medium":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/3422/conversions/red-light-cafe-thumb_medium.jpg","tags":[],"created_at":"2019-09-04T18:29:12+00:00","updated_at":"2019-09-04T18:29:12+00:00","category":{"id":1,"name":"Music","slug":"music","is_default":true,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/674/category-music.jpg","created_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00"}}},{"id":670,"name":"Whitney","slug":"whitney-september-20-2019-music-variety-playhouse","location_id":10,"user_id":1,"category_id":1,"event_type_id":2,"start_date":"2019-09-20","end_date":null,"price":"$28 - $30","start_time":"8:00 PM","end_time":"11:00 PM","short_description":"See live music at Variety Playhouse on Friday, September 20th.

Unlike some bars, one of the best burgers in the city actually resides at The Earl. Other options are tasty too, vegans and vegetarians are allowed to come here!\r\n\r\nWhat really sets them apart is the type of people you see here. You walk up and there's a nice cozy outside patio area. Walk inside and there's a plethora of tables and a good sized bar area. The people here are so nice and down to earth, the bartenders obviously have plenty of regulars here.\r\n\r\nSmoking is allowed in the bar area and on occasion inside the music room, but typically it's smoke-free for shows. Talking about shows, there's so much to say! They have a tiny little bar area back there, but luckily a ton of room overall to see your band play. The Earl has the most intimate music area at least that I've seen – you can get super close to the band, it's up to you how much hearing loss you're okay with.\r\n\r\nThe sound is excellent, unfortunately the awesome sound guy they have now is leaving, so hopefully the quality can keep up.

Unlike some bars, one of the best burgers in the city actually resides at The Earl. Other options are tasty too, vegans and vegetarians are allowed to come here!\r\n\r\nWhat really sets them apart is the type of people you see here. You walk up and there's a nice cozy outside patio area. Walk inside and there's a plethora of tables and a good sized bar area. The people here are so nice and down to earth, the bartenders obviously have plenty of regulars here.\r\n\r\nSmoking is allowed in the bar area and on occasion inside the music room, but typically it's smoke-free for shows. Talking about shows, there's so much to say! They have a tiny little bar area back there, but luckily a ton of room overall to see your band play. The Earl has the most intimate music area at least that I've seen – you can get super close to the band, it's up to you how much hearing loss you're okay with.\r\n\r\nThe sound is excellent, unfortunately the awesome sound guy they have now is leaving, so hopefully the quality can keep up. Nonetheless, The Earl has great acts pretty consistently and is such a great place to see music at, one of the best in the city.","is_family_friendly":false,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/theearl.jpg","thumb_small":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_small.jpg","thumb_medium":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_medium.jpg","tags":[{"name":"dive bar","slug":"dive-bar"},{"name":"indie music","slug":"indie-music"}],"created_at":"2019-05-13T17:09:39+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:16:24+00:00","category":{"id":1,"name":"Music","slug":"music","is_default":true,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/674/category-music.jpg","created_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00"}},"bands":[{"id":661,"name":"Songhoy Blues","slug":"songhoy-blues","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1835/661-songhoy-blues.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/5fpQ5Qt2BKgoVBSMw4Z17Z","created_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:36+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:36+00:00"}]},{"id":994,"name":"Tiffany","slug":"tiffany-september-23-2019-music-terminal-west","location_id":3,"user_id":1,"category_id":1,"event_type_id":2,"start_date":"2019-09-23","end_date":null,"price":"$38.50+","start_time":"7:00 PM","end_time":"11:00 PM","short_description":"See live music at Terminal West on Monday, September 23rd.

Unlike some bars, one of the best burgers in the city actually resides at The Earl. Other options are tasty too, vegans and vegetarians are allowed to come here!\r\n\r\nWhat really sets them apart is the type of people you see here. You walk up and there's a nice cozy outside patio area. Walk inside and there's a plethora of tables and a good sized bar area. The people here are so nice and down to earth, the bartenders obviously have plenty of regulars here.\r\n\r\nSmoking is allowed in the bar area and on occasion inside the music room, but typically it's smoke-free for shows. Talking about shows, there's so much to say! They have a tiny little bar area back there, but luckily a ton of room overall to see your band play. The Earl has the most intimate music area at least that I've seen – you can get super close to the band, it's up to you how much hearing loss you're okay with.\r\n\r\nThe sound is excellent, unfortunately the awesome sound guy they have now is leaving, so hopefully the quality can keep up. Nonetheless, The Earl has great acts pretty consistently and is such a great place to see music at, one of the best in the city.","is_family_friendly":false,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/theearl.jpg","thumb_small":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_small.jpg","thumb_medium":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_medium.jpg","tags":[{"name":"dive bar","slug":"dive-bar"},{"name":"indie music","slug":"indie-music"}],"created_at":"2019-05-13T17:09:39+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:16:24+00:00","category":{"id":1,"name":"Music","slug":"music","is_default":true,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/674/category-music.jpg","created_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00"}},"bands":[{"id":662,"name":"Agent Orange","slug":"agent-orange","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1838/662-agent-orange.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6FMvbrtsEABdXPr9emv1MI","created_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:43+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:44+00:00"},{"id":663,"name":"The Turbo A.C.'s","slug":"the-turbo-acs","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1839/663-the-turbo-acs.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/49HdCHozbzc59Ychd6VoAr","created_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:43+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:46+00:00"},{"id":664,"name":"Night Terrors","slug":"night-terrors","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1840/664-night-terrors.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6EVd4TkY2Zimdu7y4YvDrC","created_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:43+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:59:49+00:00"}]},{"id":1265,"name":"Emo Philips","slug":"emo-philips-september-26-2019-comedy-laughing-skull-lounge","location_id":11,"user_id":1,"category_id":3,"event_type_id":2,"start_date":"2019-09-26","end_date":null,"price":"$25.00 - $35.00","start_time":"8:00 PM","end_time":"11:00 PM","short_description":"Catch some laughs at Laughing Skull Lounge on Thursday, September 26th, starting at 12:00 AM.

Unlike some bars, one of the best burgers in the city actually resides at The Earl. Other options are tasty too, vegans and vegetarians are allowed to come here!\r\n\r\nWhat really sets them apart is the type of people you see here. You walk up and there's a nice cozy outside patio area. Walk inside and there's a plethora of tables and a good sized bar area. The people here are so nice and down to earth, the bartenders obviously have plenty of regulars here.\r\n\r\nSmoking is allowed in the bar area and on occasion inside the music room, but typically it's smoke-free for shows. Talking about shows, there's so much to say! They have a tiny little bar area back there, but luckily a ton of room overall to see your band play. The Earl has the most intimate music area at least that I've seen – you can get super close to the band, it's up to you how much hearing loss you're okay with.\r\n\r\nThe sound is excellent, unfortunately the awesome sound guy they have now is leaving, so hopefully the quality can keep up. Nonetheless, The Earl has great acts pretty consistently and is such a great place to see music at, one of the best in the city.","is_family_friendly":false,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/theearl.jpg","thumb_small":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_small.jpg","thumb_medium":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_medium.jpg","tags":[{"name":"dive bar","slug":"dive-bar"},{"name":"indie music","slug":"indie-music"}],"created_at":"2019-05-13T17:09:39+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:16:24+00:00","category":{"id":1,"name":"Music","slug":"music","is_default":true,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/674/category-music.jpg","created_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00"}},"bands":[{"id":102,"name":"Great Peacock","slug":"great-peacock","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/938/102-great-peacock.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/5PMyfGJxTdk91f1MxHw7Uv","created_at":"2019-07-09T16:54:19+00:00","updated_at":"2019-07-09T16:54:19+00:00"},{"id":103,"name":"The Underhill Family Orchestra","slug":"the-underhill-family-orchestra","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/939/103-the-underhill-family-orchestra.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6CLtrDyMbsjbKaOmIfqPvr","created_at":"2019-07-09T16:54:19+00:00","updated_at":"2019-07-09T16:54:22+00:00"}]},{"id":1028,"name":"The Titos","slug":"the-titos-september-27-2019-music-eddies-attic","location_id":7,"user_id":1,"category_id":1,"event_type_id":2,"start_date":"2019-09-27","end_date":null,"price":"$12 - $15","start_time":"9:30 PM","end_time":"12:30 AM","short_description":"See live music at Eddie's Attic on Friday, September 27th.
