Unlike some bars, one of the best burgers in the city actually resides at The Earl. Other options are tasty too, vegans and vegetarians are allowed to come here!\r\n\r\nWhat really sets them apart is the type of people you see here. You walk up and there's a nice cozy outside patio area. Walk inside and there's a plethora of tables and a good sized bar area. The people here are so nice and down to earth, the bartenders obviously have plenty of regulars here.\r\n\r\nSmoking is allowed in the bar area and on occasion inside the music room, but typically it's smoke-free for shows. Talking about shows, there's so much to say! They have a tiny little bar area back there, but luckily a ton of room overall to see your band play. The Earl has the most intimate music area at least that I've seen â€“ you can get super close to the band, it's up to you how much hearing loss you're okay with.\r\n\r\nThe sound is excellent, unfortunately the awesome sound guy they have now is leaving, so hopefully the quality can keep up. Nonetheless, The Earl has great acts pretty consistently and is such a great place to see music at, one of the best in the city.","is_family_friendly":false,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/theearl.jpg","thumb_small":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_small.jpg","thumb_medium":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/109/conversions/theearl-thumb_medium.jpg","tags":[{"name":"dive bar","slug":"dive-bar"},{"name":"indie music","slug":"indie-music"}],"created_at":"2019-05-13T17:09:39+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:16:24+00:00","category":{"id":1,"name":"Music","slug":"music","is_default":true,"photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/674/category-music.jpg","created_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-13T17:06:30+00:00"}},"bands":[{"id":629,"name":"New Junk City","slug":"new-junk-city","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1787/629-new-junk-city.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4kcvkXddIYZxnvLue1uPOM","created_at":"2019-08-12T13:57:12+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:57:12+00:00"},{"id":630,"name":"Gabbie Rotts","slug":"gabbie-rotts","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1788/630-gabbie-rotts.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Nx7m5g6RKIhbLxhOutlNj","created_at":"2019-08-12T13:57:12+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:57:15+00:00"},{"id":631,"name":"Ozello","slug":"ozello","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1789/631-ozello.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4hmqrWAGNjuD7x9AALS5d0","created_at":"2019-08-12T13:57:12+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:57:17+00:00"},{"id":632,"name":"Dead Selves","slug":"dead-selves","photo":"https://funinatl.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1790/632-dead-selves.jpeg","spotify_url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6ddE4GaKnGN9zvDpOXbnUA","created_at":"2019-08-12T13:57:12+00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12T13:57:20+00:00"}]}}
